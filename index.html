        <h1>My-Story</h1>
        <h2>by Joselyn Melendez</h2>
        <p>My Daily routine: 
            <p>I wake up and brush my teeth.</p>
            <p>Then I get dressed and go to school.
            <p>It takes about 30 minutes to get to Lane if traffic isnt bad.</p>
            <p>At school I go to all of my classes.</p>
            <p>I take Driver's Ed, Chemistry, Trig., AP World History, Spanish, Programming, and English II.</p>
            <p>I am in Omega which is the humanities version of Alpha.</p>
            <p>Basically that means my english and history classes are at a higher level than core english classes.</p>
            <p>(Honestly I didn't really like my english teacher, but its the end of the year so I'll be okay.)</p>
            <p>After school I usually have dance practice from 3:30 to 6:30.</p>
            <p>After practice I go home and take a shower.</p>
            <p>Then I eat dinner and do my homework. </p>
            <p>Then I mess around on my phone for way longer than I'd like to admit </p>
            <p>Then I fall alseep. </p>
