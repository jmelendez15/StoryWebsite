        <h1>My-Story</h1>
        <h2>by Mr. Berg's 7th period</h2>
        <p>My Daily routine: 
            I wake up and brush my teeth.
            Then I get dressed and go to school.
            At school I go to all of my classes.
            After school I usually have practice.
            After practice I go home and take a shower.
            Then I eat dinner and do my homework. 
            Then I mess around on my phone. 
            Then I fall alseep. </p>
